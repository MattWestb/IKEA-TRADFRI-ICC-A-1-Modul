### Home Assistant
ICC-A-1 is up and running on HA with EZSP ver 6.6.4.0 and 6.7.4.0.  
Use 115200 as comport speed and if you like tasmoat as TCP UART.  
Funny thing HA saying its a deCONZ coordinator (HA bug then some of my devices was in my deCONZ before).  
Current status its that its looks being problems with newer Zigbee 3 devices or timing problems.  
The devs its digging deeper and deeper so very soon they finding the problem.
